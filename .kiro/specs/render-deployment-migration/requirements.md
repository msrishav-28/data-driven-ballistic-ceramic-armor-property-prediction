# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of the ceramic armor ML prediction system from Streamlit to Render deployment platform. The goal is to create a production-ready FastAPI backend with a modern web interface that can be deployed on Render, providing better scalability, performance, and professional deployment capabilities for the ceramic armor property prediction system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a materials researcher, I want to access the ceramic armor prediction system through a professional web API, so that I can integrate predictions into my research workflows and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/predict/mechanical` THEN the system SHALL return mechanical property predictions with confidence intervals
2. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/predict/ballistic` THEN the system SHALL return ballistic property predictions with uncertainty quantification
3. WHEN a user accesses the API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
4. WHEN the API receives invalid input data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a modern web interface for the prediction system, so that I can easily input material parameters and visualize results without technical API knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a responsive HTML form for material composition input
2. WHEN a user submits material parameters THEN the system SHALL display predictions in an organized, readable format
3. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL show interactive visualizations of results and confidence intervals
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions and examples for proper usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to be deployable on Render, so that it can be hosted reliably with automatic deployments and scaling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Render THEN the system SHALL start successfully and respond to health checks
2. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN Render SHALL automatically deploy the updated application
3. WHEN the application receives traffic THEN Render SHALL handle load balancing and scaling automatically
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL use them for API keys and configuration settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track system performance and debug issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request details, processing time, and response status
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with stack traces
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL log initialization status and configuration details
4. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL log model performance metrics and feature importance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to handle file uploads for batch predictions, so that I can process multiple materials efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CSV file with material data THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and contents
2. WHEN batch processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL process all materials and return results in downloadable format
3. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without timeout errors
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download links for results and visualizations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a materials scientist, I want access to model interpretability features, so that I can understand which material properties drive the predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide SHAP feature importance values
2. WHEN a user requests model explanation THEN the system SHALL return feature contribution analysis
3. WHEN visualizations are requested THEN the system SHALL generate interactive plots showing feature impacts
4. WHEN model confidence is low THEN the system SHALL highlight uncertain predictions with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the API to be secure and rate-limited, so that the system is protected from abuse and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 status with retry information
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate API keys or tokens properly
3. WHEN input validation fails THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs and prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow appropriate cross-origin requests while blocking unauthorized domains

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API testing and documentation, so that I can integrate with the system reliably and understand all available endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is accessed THEN comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation SHALL be available at `/docs`
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN all API endpoints SHALL pass validation and return expected responses
3. WHEN API schemas change THEN documentation SHALL be automatically updated to reflect current interfaces
4. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL include realistic material data and expected response formats
